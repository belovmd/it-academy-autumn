You are given a string where you have to find its first word.
When solving a task pay attention to the following points:
    There can be dots and commas in a string.
    A string can start with a letter or, for example, a dot or space.
    A word can contain an apostrophe and it's a part of a word.
    The whole text can be represented with one word and that's it.

In this mission your task is to determine the popularity of certain words in the text.
At the input of your function are given 2 arguments:
the text and the array of words the popularity of which you need to determine.

When solving this task pay attention to the following points:
The words should be sought in all registers.
This means that if you need to find a word "one" then words like:
 "one", "One", "oNe", "ONE" etc. will do.
The search words are always indicated in the lowercase.
If the word wasnâ€™t found even once, it has to be returned in the dictionary with 0 (zero) value.
