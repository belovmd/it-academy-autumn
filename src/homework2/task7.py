First word:
You are given a string where you have to find its first word.
When solving a task pay attention to the following points:
    There can be dots and commas in a string.
    A string can start with a letter or, for example, a dot or space.
    A word can contain an apostrophe and it's a part of a word.
    The whole text can be represented with one word and that's it.

You are given a non-empty list of integers (X).
For this task, you should return a list consisting

list only once). When solving this task, do not
change the order of the list. Example: [1, 2, 3, 1, 3]

Popular words:
In this mission your task is to determine the popularity
of certain words in the text. At the input of your function
are given 2 arguments: the text and the array of words
the popularity of which you need to determine.

When solving this task pay attention to the following points:
The words should be sought in all registers.
This means that if you need to find a word "one" then words like:
"one", "One", "oNe", "ONE" etc. will do.
The search words are always indicated in the lowercase.
If the word wasnâ€™t found even once, it has to be returned
in the dictionary with 0 (zero) value.
